# Bitcamp-Proposals

This is a repository of information about our current and previous Bitcamps, and it is the place to propose what Bitcamps we should develop. Thank you for your interest in Bit Project! We strive to have an active and collaborative community of students and recent graduates. Please join the conversation and learn more about our organization on [bitproject.org](https://bitproject.org) and join the community on Discord!

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for a guide to contributing in general to one of our current projects, and which ones are currently in development.

See `ProposalTemplate.md` for the format to follow to make a proposal. The steps to actually propose a camp is here:
* Clone the repository to your machine
* Make a copy of `ProposalTemplate.md` and fill it in with your proposed format and material
* Create a Pull Request in this repository with your doc added to `AddProposalsHere/`, and tag @kylebegovich to make sure he receives a notification for your proposal
* Be prepared for a conversation! Before moving forward with projects, we will likely have some questions about the content and want to get on a call.
